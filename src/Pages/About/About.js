            <p>I am Tanni Rani Dey, a student of Programming Hero. I want to be a full stack web developer.
                Although it is very difficult to maintain the flow of the course with daily work, I am trying my best to learn the tasks well. For which most of the time you have to compromise with sleep. I have removed myself from a lot of unnecessary things, the time I put behind my work so that I can see myself as a web developer of any software company in the next 6 months.</p>
